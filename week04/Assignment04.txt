Homework assignment:

Chapter 9, Review Question 1. What is the difference between an actual argument and a formal parameter?

Chapter 9, Programming Exercise 3. Write a function that takes three arguments: a character and two integers. The character is to be printed. The first integer specifies the number of times that the character is to be printed on a line, and the second integer specifies the number of lines that are to be printed. Write a program that makes use of this function.

Chapter 9, Programming Exercise 4. The harmonic mean of two numbers is obtained by taking the inverses of the two numbers, averaging them, and taking the inverse of the result. Write a function that takes two double arguments and returns the harmonic mean of the two numbers.

Write a function integerPower(base, exponent) that returns the value of base**exponent. For example, integerPower(3, 4) = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3. Assume that exponent is a positive, nonzero integer, and base is an integer. The function integerPower should use a for loop to control the calculation. Do not use any math library functions.
