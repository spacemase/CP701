==========================
=      QUESTIONS         =
==========================

Why is it that I cannot declare my preprocessor constants using double 
literals (with the trailing 'D') like so?

  #define TAX_RATE .25D



Why can I not declare one constant using another in the definition?

  #define TAX_LIMIT_1  300
  #define TAX_LIMIT_2  TAX_LIMIT_1 + 150

TAX_LIMIT_2 is equal to 0+150 when I do this
