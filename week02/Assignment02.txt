b) x = (12 + 6)/2*3;
c) y = x = (2 + 3) / 4;
d) y = 3 + 2*(x = 7 / 2);

Chapter 5, Programming Exercise 2. Write a program that asks for an integer and then prints all the integers from (and including) that value up to (and including) a value larger by 10. (That is, if the input is 5, the output runs from 5 to 15). Be sure to separate each output value by a space or tab or newline.
